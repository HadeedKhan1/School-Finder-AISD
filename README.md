# School-Finder-AISD
This program gets the school code and finds the AISD school that associates with it.
School code can be found when hovering on someone's google profile and is the second number.
For example, in 10 â€¢ 007 the school code is 007.  It can be used to find what school old friends go to now.  For now, only AustinISD High and Middle schools work with this. 
All AISD Elementary, Middle, High, and special Academies have been added  
Fixes/Updates: None yet.
